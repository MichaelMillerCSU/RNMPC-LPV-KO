## There are 2 main examples: the Van der Pol system and Duffing system are shown in the paper, and an addtional example of the normal oscillator system.
### The file VDP.m, Duffing.m and Normal_Oscillator are corresponding to the different system with Min-Max K-RMPC. The function of the dynamics should be changed if running KMPC.m.
